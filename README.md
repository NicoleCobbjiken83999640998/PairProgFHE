# PairProgFHE

A secure, cloud-based IDE that enables fully encrypted pair programming through the use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). PairProgFHE allows multiple developers to collaboratively edit, debug, and review encrypted codebases in real-time‚Äîwithout ever decrypting the data on the server. This ensures that the source code, logic, and intellectual property remain protected even during active collaboration.

## Overview

Traditional cloud-based IDEs expose code to servers, maintainers, or third-party infrastructures, creating substantial risks for privacy, leaks, and unauthorized access. In contrast, PairProgFHE introduces a new paradigm: **end-to-end encrypted collaborative development**, powered by **FHE**.

With FHE, code can be analyzed, compiled, or linted directly in its encrypted form. Developers can view and edit only the parts they have permission for, while servers and peers never see the plaintext code.

PairProgFHE is designed for organizations, research teams, and developers who require strong confidentiality without sacrificing productivity or collaboration.

## Key Features

### üîí End-to-End Encrypted Collaboration
All code edits, diffs, and interactions are encrypted on the client side using FHE. The server never accesses plaintext, ensuring complete data confidentiality.

### üß† FHE-Powered Real-Time Sync
Changes made by one participant are synchronized with others via FHE-protected channels. This guarantees that computations‚Äîsuch as syntax highlighting or compilation checks‚Äîare performed on encrypted data.

### üß© Secure Multi-User Session Management
Each collaborative session is cryptographically isolated. Only authorized developers can join or modify shared workspaces, and session keys are managed locally, never exposed to the cloud.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Privacy-Preserving Debugging
Developers can debug encrypted applications collaboratively, with encrypted stack traces, variable states, and logs that can be analyzed without revealing plaintext values.

### üåê Zero-Trust Cloud Infrastructure
PairProgFHE assumes the cloud cannot be trusted. All critical data paths‚Äîsource code, keystrokes, synchronization streams‚Äîare encrypted end-to-end.

### üîÅ Homomorphic Compilation & Linting
The FHE layer allows basic compilation tasks, syntax checks, and even performance hints to be computed directly over ciphertexts. This enables real-time feedback without compromising confidentiality.

## Why FHE Matters

Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables operations on encrypted data as though it were unencrypted. For a collaborative IDE, this is revolutionary:

‚Ä¢ It eliminates the need for decryption on any remote server.  
‚Ä¢ It ensures that even in multi-party sessions, code remains confidential.  
‚Ä¢ It protects intellectual property during cloud-based development.  
‚Ä¢ It provides verifiable integrity of computation without exposing data.  

PairProgFHE demonstrates how FHE can bridge security and collaboration‚Äîa challenge that has limited the adoption of cloud-based IDEs in sensitive environments like defense, finance, and AI research.

## Architecture

### Client Layer
- Local encryption of all edits, commits, and interactions using FHE-based schemes  
- Secure key storage within local browser or OS environment  
- Real-time encrypted synchronization through WebSocket channels  

### Server Layer
- Stateless relay of encrypted payloads between clients  
- FHE-compliant computation layer for syntax, formatting, and build tasks  
- Multi-tenant encryption spaces ensuring user data isolation  

### Compiler & Execution Layer
- Homomorphic-compatible intermediate representation (IR) for encrypted computation  
- Encrypted compilation pipeline supporting differential builds  
- Deterministic evaluation of encrypted code integrity checks  

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:**  
React + TypeScript + WebAssembly FHE runtime  

**Backend:**  
Rust-based encrypted collaboration engine  
FHE libraries optimized for CKKS and BFV schemes  
Containerized session routers for real-time communication  

**Security:**  
Zero-knowledge session proofs  
Client-side key derivation (Argon2)  
FHE-based access control verification  

## Example Workflow

1. Developer A opens an encrypted project and initiates a collaboration session.  
2. Developer B joins using a secure session key exchange.  
3. Both developers edit encrypted code locally; diffs are FHE-encrypted.  
4. The IDE performs encrypted linting and build checks in real time.  
5. The final encrypted binary can be securely deployed or audited without ever decrypting the source.  

## Security Model

PairProgFHE is designed with a zero-trust mindset:  
‚Ä¢ Servers act only as blind routers.  
‚Ä¢ All data remains encrypted in transit and at rest.  
‚Ä¢ Session participants verify authenticity via zero-knowledge handshakes.  
‚Ä¢ Compilers and debuggers never require plaintext access.  

## Advantages Over Traditional IDEs

| Aspect | Traditional Cloud IDE | PairProgFHE |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|
| Code Privacy | Visible to provider | Encrypted end-to-end |
| Collaboration | Server-mediated | Peer-synced, encrypted |
| Compilation | Plaintext builds | Homomorphic computation |
| Debugging | Exposes runtime data | Encrypted state inspection |
| Trust Model | Requires trusted backend | Fully zero-trust |

## Deployment

### Local Setup
1. Install Node.js and Rust toolchains  
2. Clone the repository and build the FHE runtime module  
3. Run `npm start` to launch the encrypted IDE locally  

### Cloud Deployment
PairProgFHE supports containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.  
All encryption keys remain outside the cloud, ensuring safe execution even on untrusted infrastructure.

## Future Roadmap

- Enhanced FHE optimization for faster real-time collaboration  
- Offline encrypted editing with deferred synchronization  
- Integration with privacy-preserving CI/CD pipelines  
- Multi-language FHE compiler support (Python, C++, Rust)  
- Support for secure code review using homomorphic diff visualization
